### Movement simulation exercises
Emulate the following scenarios:

**Scenario 1 -** There are four nodes: one Android device (node N1) and three beacons (B1, B2, and B3). Simulate the scenario where the three beacons are placed sequentially on a street, set apart from each other, and a user which is carrying the device N1 goes past each beacon one by one. Write a script that automates the movement performed by the user. Use the wait command to introduce delays as the user moves past each beacon.

**Scenario 2 -** There are two Android devices: node N1 and N2. Simulate the scenario where they approach each other and move apart after some time. In this case, you need to launch a second emulator and associate it with node N2.

### Group formation groups
Modify the MsgSender application in order to support a conversational operation mode, in which the users can exchange multiple messages in the same connection. In the current version of MsgSender, one message only is allowed to be sent to a remote party per connection.
