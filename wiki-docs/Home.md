# Termite
Termite is a software emulation testbed that allows developers to run Android applications on virtual encounter networks.

Here you'll find documentation about the features that Termite offers to developers, as well as documentation on its API.
This information is further explained with concrete examples that feature not only source code but also visual representation on the interactions between the entities involved in a Termite testing environment.
