# Termite API Guide
In order for an application to interact with Termite, it must be packaged with the [Termite API library](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~wiki/courses/cmu1516/lab04/Termite-WifiP2P-API-20160329.tgz) and make use of its services. Several steps must be done to integrate and use the Termite API in an application. We now explain these steps, and refer the reader to the [PeerScanner](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~wiki/courses/cmu1516/lab04/Termite-WifiP2P-PeerScanner-20160329.tgz), and [MsgSender](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~wiki/courses/cmu1516/lab04/Termite-WifiP2P-MsgSender-20160329.tgz) demo applications used in the tutorial's [lesson 2](Device Detection) and [lesson 4](WiFi Groups & Messages) respectively. Most of the examples used in this section were taken from those demo apps.
